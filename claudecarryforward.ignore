Plan: Interaction Range Indicators

  Concept

  A visual feedback system showing where player actions will apply, based on cursor position constrained to an interaction radius around the player.

  Core Components

  1. Interaction Range Calculation
    - Define INTERACTION_RANGE (e.g., 2 tiles) in config.py
    - Function to find the tile closest to cursor that's within range of player
    - Snaps cursor to nearest valid tile when outside range
  2. Highlight Rendering (in render/map.py)
    - Primary highlight: The tile that will be affected (bright outline or tint)
    - Range indicator: Subtle border or dimmed overlay showing all reachable tiles
    - Different highlight colors by action type:
        - Build: blue outline + red if occupied/invalid
      - Dig/terrain: yellow outline
      - Collect/interact: green outline
  3. State Tracking (in ui_state.py)
    - hovered_tile: Optional[Tuple[int, int]] - tile under cursor
    - target_tile: Optional[Tuple[int, int]] - clamped to interaction range
    - Updated each frame from mouse position via virtual_to_world()
  4. Tool-Specific Indicators
    - Build tools: Show structure footprint + blocked indicator if tile has structure/rock
    - Shovel: Show elevation change preview
    - Pour: Maybe show water spread preview

  Implementation Order

  1. Add interaction range constant and clamping logic
  2. Add target_tile tracking to ui_state
  3. Render basic tile highlight in render/map.py
  4. Add tool-specific validation/coloring
  5. Add range boundary visualization (optional polish)

  This gives clear feedback for where actions land without complex targeting UI.
